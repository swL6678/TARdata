fingerprintdata1 and fingerprintdata2 are the fingerprint library data reduced by the TOA coarse localization point and the fingerprint library data reduced by the TOA coarse localization point, respectively. In fingerprintdata1 and fingerprintdata2: the first and second rows indicate the coordinates of the reference point on the x and y axes, respectively. Rows 3-6 indicate the azimuthal angle (AOA) from the four base stations to the reference point; rows 7-10 indicate the RSS from the four base stations to the reference point.
The nearest, Matching weights denote the nearest neighbors and corresponding weights obtained in fingerprintdata1, respectively. Serial numbers 1,2, 3 denote the results of matching ISAWKNN algorithm, WKNN algorithm, and SAWKNN algorithm, respectively.
fxz denotes the military more error of different localization methods obtained by randomly selecting 24 points in the localization area after 200 Monte Carlo experiments.
